# De[code] Sub[strate]

<sub><sup>† This software is experimental, and not intended for production use yet. Use at your own risk.

Encompassing decoder for substrate/polkadot/kusama types.

Gets type definitions from polkadot-js via JSON and decodes them into components
that outline types and make decoding byte-strings possible, as long as the
module/generic type name are known.

Supports Metadata versions from v8, which means all of Kusama (from CC1). Older networks are not supported (E.G Alexander).
   - makes decoding generic types from the substrate rpc possible
   - requires parsing JSON with type definitions, and implementing traits
      `TypeDetective` and `Decoder` in order to work for arbitrary chains.
      However, if the JSON follows the same format as PolkadotJS definitions
      (look at `definitions.json` and `overrides.json`) it would be possible to
      simply deserialize into Polkadot structs and utilize those. The decoding
      itself is generic enough to allow it.
   - types must adhere to the conventions set out by polkadot decoding
      - type definitions for Polkadot (Kusama) are taken from Polkadot.js and deserialized into Rust (extras/polkadot)
