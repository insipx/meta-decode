# Locally-Patched `sp-core` packages.

Usually, a dependency needs to be updated (generally parity-util mem). Dependencies which diverge
from the original package are topped with a comment of the format:
`# PATCHED.insipx.2021Aug20 from `version = "0.7.0"`
	- this is mostly to easily & quickly rg patched dependencies
