## Definitions

overrides.json and definitions.json are taken directly from polkadot-js via [polkadot-json-definitions](https://github.com/insipx/polkadot-json-definitions)
extrinsics.json is created in the same style but maintained directly. Extrinsics.json contains definitions for Signature, Address, and SignedExtra
